We confirmed that it is necessary to conceptualize cross-modal mapping before experiencing music sensory substitution through focus group interviews with 24 DHH people. To improve the music appreciation experience, a cross-modal music conceptualization system was implemented herein, which is a prototype that allows DHH people to explore the visuals and vibrations associated with music to perceive and appreciate. An evaluation with 28 DHH individuals demonstrated the capability of the system to improve subjective music appreciation experience via music-sensory substitution.
