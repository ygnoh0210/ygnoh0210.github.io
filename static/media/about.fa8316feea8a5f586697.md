HeyðŸ‘‹! Warm greetings from GIST in Korea. 


Just over here soaking up the world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My thing? User modeling. I'm vibing with some cool concepts from cognitive science, and weaving them into Game AI, AR/VR, and Gaze modeling. Mostly, I'm jamming in Python, but you'll also find me hanging with projects in JavaScript and C#. Catch you on the digital waveðŸŒŠ!
