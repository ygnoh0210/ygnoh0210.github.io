I'm currently a Ph.D. student advised by Professor [Jin-Hyuk Hong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iTu5G9QAAAAJ) at GIST, in the [Soft Computing & Interaction Lab](https://iit.gist.ac.kr/sci/index.do). I'm particularly interested in understanding users through conversational and linguistic features, with a focus on designing **AI-powered applications**. This also extends to the development of **conversational agents**. Additionally, I have experience conducting research with **special groups**, such as deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) individuals and dementia patients. Lately, I've been expanding my interests into understanding the unique characteristics of individuals in the user's **gaze** and their applications in **AR/VR** environments.
